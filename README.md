# AI-chatbot
I built a small AI chatbot using the LLaMA 3.2: 1B model. It has a web interface made with Streamlit. The chatbot gives short and limited answers (only up to 2023 data). It also asks users for feedback after replying. This project helped me understand how to use a language model and connect it to a web app.
